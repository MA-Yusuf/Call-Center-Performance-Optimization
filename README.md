PROBLEM STATEMENT

In the last quarter, the call center experienced a significantdrop in customer satisfaction scores. The call center also faced delayed response times, inconsistent agent performance, and unresolved issues during first contact. However, the absence of a centralized, real-time reporting system made it difficult for managers to identify trends, respond quickly, and implement corrective actions.
